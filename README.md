# Spam Message Identification
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify spam messages. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and EDA to analyze and classify text messages as either spam or non-spam (ham).

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled text messages, where each message is annotated as spam or ham. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information and prepared for training the machine learning model.

It is specifically designed for text classification tasks. The model is trained using labeled data, enabling it to learn patterns and features indicative of spam messages. Streamlit is used for front-end
